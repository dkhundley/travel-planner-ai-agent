    "In this section, we'll demonstrate how to create our own custom tools to supply to the agent. Fortunately, Strands makes this extremely easy as all we really need to do is to decorate a standard Python function with `@tool`. Please be aware that having a docstring in your Python function is a MUST as this is essentially the blueprint that is provided to the Strands agent on knowing how to properly make use of this \"tool\".\n",
    "\n",
    "To keep things simple, we're going to create two custom tools: a calculator and a thing that returns the current date and time. Generally speaking, language models are hit or miss when it comes to calculation. By definition, a language model should have no knowledge of the current date and time since language models are trained at a snapshot in time. In simpler words, we're intentionally creating these tools as mechanisms to help perform tasks that language models either do poorly or can't do at all."
